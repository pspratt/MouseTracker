This project was undertaken to avoid the purchase of [expensive proprietary rodent tracking software](http://www.anymaze.co.uk/anymaze-developing-countries-licence.htm) and to learn approaches to tracking objects in videos. The toolbox works quite robustly, however more modern and flexible opensource tools for ethological tracking now exist ([DeepLab cut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut)).
