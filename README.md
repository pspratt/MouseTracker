# mouseTracker
MouseTracker is a MATLAB toolbox made the track the position of mice during common behavioral tests such as the open field test, elevated plus maze, and three chamber social assay.

This project was made in 2016 to avoid the purchase of [expensive proprietary rodent tracking software](http://www.anymaze.co.uk/anymaze-developing-countries-licence.htm) and to learn how to track objects in videos. The toolbox works quite robustly, however much more modern opensource tools now exist ([DeepLab cut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut)).
